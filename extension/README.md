# eafc_analysis

This is a personal project to track data on EA FC Ultimate Team web app. A chrome extension is used to passively track the items from opened packs. Currently, this is just printed to the console. In future updates it will include uploading the information to a server and storing it on a database. Data Analysis will then be performed on the results.
